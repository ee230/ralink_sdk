PPPoEcd 2.4.1
$Id: README,v 1.1 2008-08-04 06:11:52 winfred Exp $

This is PPPoEcd, a PPPoE client daemon. It is essentially a
stripped-down version of PPPd with

- minimal options support (see options.c)
- statically linked PPPoE client support
- PAP/CHAP/CCP only

Private versions of pppd.h and pppoe.h are used in this directory to

- override debug function calls
- override non-applicable function calls
- compile out non-applicable code paths through static const options

Most of the common-code protocol files have been left alone. A lot of
dead code could probably be stripped from them, but most of the bloat
was in sys-linux.o and options.o.

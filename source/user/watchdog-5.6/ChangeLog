	- Watchdog 1.0 released.

Tue Mar  5 09:11:34 MET 1996

	- Fixed two bugs in watchdog.c reported (and patched) by 
	  Johannes Kroeger <fiction!squirrel.owl.de!jkroeger@golden-gate.owl.de>:
	  Watchdog now tries to open /dev/watchdog before tugging its
	  process ID away.

	- Released version 1.1

Thu May 23 14:20:59 MET DST 1996

	  process table is full
 
Mon Jul 29 13:51:42 MET DST 1996

	- Finally watchdog is able to shut down the system even if
	  the process table remains full after killing all processes.

	- Released version 2.0 (this was a major overhaul)

Fri Jan 31 13:39:43 MET 1997

	- Disconnect deamon from console.

	- Close file descriptors 0, 1, 2 when compiled with USE_SYSLOG.

	- Cleaned up source code.

	- Write the softdog device between each check, since the increasing
	  number of checks might cause problems otherise.

	- Test the system load average and reboot if it is too high.

Thu Apr  3 11:14:07 MET DST 1997

	- Fixed that nasty bug that caused the root partion to stay mounted
	  during a soft reboot.

	- Fixed another bug that caused watchdog to kill itself during
	  reboot before all the work was done.

Wed Jun  4 20:16:23 CEST 1997

	- Finally soft reboot works as advertised.

	  network/host does not answer.

Wen Jun 11 09:25:36 CEST 1997

	- Added file table check: reboot if file table overflow occurs.

Mon Jun 16 12:10:55 CEST 1997

	- Make sure files are only opened once.
	- Work even if there is no /dev/watchdog.

Mon Jun 30 21:07:39 CEST 1997

	- Implemented temperature test.
	- Added double fork() to inherit rights from init. Now watchdog will
          unmount all partitions correctly regardless what your current
          working directory is when you start it. My thanks go to Peter Tobias
          <tobias@et-inf.fho-emden.de> for pointing me into the right direction.

Wed Jul  2 11:00:49 CEST 1997

Tue Dec  2 10:02:43 CET 1997

	- Stupid me! Somehow I managed to release my test version without
          removing the call to halt the system regardless of the temperature
          that I used for my last test. I'm sorry. Hope it didn't cause too
          much problems.

	  hang can occur there.

Thu Sep 10 17:22:32 CEST 1998

	  send me the patches. Unfortunately I lost his email-address.

	- Switched to GNU autoconf, work done by Sascha Schumann
	  <sas@schell.de>.
